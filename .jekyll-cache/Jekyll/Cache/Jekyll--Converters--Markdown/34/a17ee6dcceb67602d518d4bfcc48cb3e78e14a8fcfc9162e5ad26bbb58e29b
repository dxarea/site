Iâ€™ve got work to do! Itâ€™s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it right now. Itâ€™s such a long way from here.</p>

<h3 id="i-care-so-what-do-you-think-of-her-han">I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</h3>
<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Your eyes can deceive you. Donâ€™t trust them.</p>

<p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Donâ€™t be too proud of this technological terror youâ€™ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>

<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. Iâ€™m trying not to, kid. Alderaan? Iâ€™m not going to Alderaan. Iâ€™ve got to go home. Itâ€™s late, Iâ€™m in for it as it is.</p>

  <li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. Thereâ€™ll be no one to stop us this time!</li>
  <li>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</li>
  <li>I want to come with you to Alderaan. Thereâ€™s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Donâ€™t be too proud of this technological terror youâ€™ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>

<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. Thereâ€™ll be no one to stop us this time!</p>

<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. Iâ€™m getting too old for this sort of thing. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>

<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>

Donâ€™t trust them. What?! I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic</p>
